# Liver Cirrhosis Stage Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

```
Accuracy: 96.12% | Dataset: 25K Records | Model: XGBoost
```

Liver cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by progressive liver damage that can lead to severe health complications if not diagnosed early. Accurate staging of the disease is essential for effective treatment planning and patient management.

This project develops a machine learning–based predictive system to determine the stage of liver cirrhosis using patient diagnosis data, including laboratory test results and clinical indicators. The system aims to assist healthcare professionals in faster and more accurate decision-making.

## 🔮 Prediction System

A prediction function was created to input patient parameters and output the predicted liver cirrhosis stage.

Example:

```
Predicted Stage: 0
```

## Model Files

Due to file size limitations, trained model files are not included in the repository.

You can generate them by running the notebook. The following files will be created automatically:

```
liver_model.pkl
scaler.pkl
```
